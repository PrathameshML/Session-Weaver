# Session-Weaver
Session Weaver is a Chrome extension that enhances your browsing history by showing not just the websites you visited, but also the exact steps you took within each site. Instead of a flat list of URLs, it organizes your journey as a tree of activitiesâ€”helping you retrace your path, revisit useful pages, or track research sessions more effectively.
